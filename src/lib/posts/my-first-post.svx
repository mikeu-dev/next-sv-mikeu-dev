## Welcome to My Blog!

This is it! My first blog post. I've been wanting to start a blog for a while now to document my journey in web development, share tutorials, and discuss new technologies.

### Why Start a Blog?

I believe that writing is one of the best ways to learn. By explaining concepts to others, I solidify my own understanding. I also hope that my posts can help other developers who are on a similar path.

### What to Expect

Here are some of the topics I plan to write about:

-   **SvelteKit & Next.js:** Deep dives into my favorite frameworks.
-   **GIS & Web Mapping:** Tutorials on integrating maps and spatial data into web apps.
-   **TypeScript:** Tips and tricks for writing more robust code.
-   **DevOps & Tooling:** Thoughts on my development workflow and tools.

Stay tuned for more content soon!
